# HR-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
This project is a comprehensive employee attendance dashboard created using Microsoft Excel and Power BI. The dashboard provides a clear and interactive view of key workforce metrics, including Present Percentage, Work From Home (WFH) Percentage, Sick Leave Percentage, and overall attendance tracking. Employee names are also dynamically displayed, making it easy to monitor individual records and attendance trends. The integration of Excel data with Power BI enables automated data visualization and reporting, making this tool ideal for HR teams and managers who need real-time insights into employee availability and attendance behavior.
